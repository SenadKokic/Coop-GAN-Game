This code implements a semi-cooperative GAN with a feedback loop, as opposed to the traditional strictly adversarial game employed in most GAN implementations. 

The data used is drawn from the CelebA dataset (via https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), and the basis for the implementation uses the DCGAN implementation
(via PyTorch, https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html).
